# Hacking Cinegy - TechCon 2016

Here are all the demo materials used in the presentation from TechCon 2016 - and a little that didn't make it on the stage.

An introduction to what can be found here is available on Cinegy Open in the Hacking Cinegy post.

All of the code in these demos are available under the Apache license as listed in the demo root - so have fun hacking and extending!

## The future

We have an intention to try and bundle up some things shown in the demo as proper libraries in a repository - when we do, we'll link this below.
