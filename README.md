##Type RSS Controller

This is a simple example application, which shows how to take an RSS feed and use it as a source to drive on-air branding.

It's licensed as Apache2, so we encourage you to take this and change it to whatever might fit your needs.

However, just to make your life easier, we auto-build this using AppVeyor - here is how we are doing right now: 

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/2bk09ir9fbouhrr2?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/cinegy/demo/branch/master)

You can check out the latest compiled binary from the master or pre-master code here:

[AppVeyor Demo Project Builder](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/cinegy/demo/build/artifacts)

If you want to fork this and build your version on AppVeyor, we include an AppVeyor.yml file in the root of this project which can get you started!
